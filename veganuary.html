        <h1>Veganuary - it's not too late to join!</h1><br><br>
        <p>Veganuary is a campaign to encourage people to try a vegan lifestyle for the month of January (we won't tell
            anyone if you start on the 2nd, it's better late than never!).
            <br>
            Over 1 million participants have taken part in the UK since 2014, and with 98% ready to recommend the
            challenge
            to a friend, we reckon there's no harm in giving it a go! Especially considering it's a great way to slash
            your
            carbon footprint and introduce some more fruit and veg into your diet. It's also easier than ever - more
            than
            1200 new vegan products and menus were launched for Veganuary 2020.
            <br>
            There's no need to throw away all your meat & dairy leftovers either, all that food waste defeats the point!
            Next time you do a food shop, why not try swapping out even some of your usual groceries for vegan
            alternatives
            this month.

        <h3>Still unsure? The Strathclyde Vegan Society has debunked some common misconceptions around veganism:</h3>
        <br><br>
        <p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;padding-left: 60px;">
            <li><b>Vegan food is expensive</b> - Meat is a lot more expensive than vegetables, pulses and grains.
                <a href="https://www.vegansociety.com/news/blog/10-cheapest-vegan-meals">Have a look at these
                    cheap vegan recipes</a>
            </li>
            <li><b>I couldn't live without X food</b> - Veganism is not about what you lose, it is about what new
                recipes and knowledge
                you gain after choosing compassion over cruelty. Plus some of your favourite snacks might already be
                vegan -
                like Oreos!</li>
            <li><b>But meat tastes so good</b> - An animal's will to live is stronger than our taste. Sensory pleasure
                cannot make a
                violent action more moral. Also vegan cooking can be really tasty!</li>
            <li><b>Eating meat is part of my culture</b> - Culture also does not make an action moral, throughout
                history there have
                been instances where minorities have suffered because it was once culturally acceptable to ostracise
                certain
                groups. Just because something is ingrained into us it should not be viewed as moral.</li>
            <li><b>Animals eat other animals out of necessity</b> - It has been proven that humans can survive solely on
                a plant based
                diet. Humans also can't be compared to other animals in this argument as we possess the knowledge of
                right and
                wrong, unlike other animals.</li>
            <li><b>Vegans are so extreme</b> - What is really more extreme, the people that are trying to stop animal
                abuse, or the
                people paying for all the pigs, chickens, cows to be slaughtered?</li>
            <li><b>Pets are different than animals killed for meat</b> - Saying that one species of animal deserves to
                be killed and
                another species deserves protection is arbitrary discrimination called 'Speciesism'</li>
            <li><b>Plants have feelings too</b> - Plants are not sentient since they do not have a brain, central
                nervous system, pain
                receptors, etc. they can react to stimuli just like computers or viruses but you wouldn't say they have
                feelings.</li>
