            After noticing a lack of vegan awareness being spread by the Union, I would like to propose a policy that
            helps amend this: helping minorities as well as the animals suffering in horrific conditions in factory
            farms for the benefit of improving human/animal wellbeing and increasing knowledge about the pollution of
            animal agriculture.
        </p>

        <h3>Student Parliament Notes: </h3><br>
        <p style="padding-left: 20px">
            After joining the Annual General Meeting (and being impressed with the current progress of the Union) I just
            wanted to write concerning the issue of spreading more awareness about veganism. I was very pleased and
            ecstatic the union put up a Veganuary page <sup>1</sup> although I believe more should be done to raise
            awareness to help
            tackle the problem.
            <br><br>
            For example, the Union is keen on protecting the environment and reducing the amount of funding directed
            towards fossil fuels but why not also talk about going plant-based being one of the easiest ways to lower
            your impact and carbon footprint? A 2018 Oxford study that is considered the most comprehensive study
            “looking into the detrimental effects farming can have on the environment and included data on nearly 40,000
            farms in 119 countries” proving that “Veganism is the ‘single biggest way’ to reduce our environmental
            impact”. <sup>2 3</sup> They also state global farmland use could be reduced by 75 per cent, an area
            equivalent to the size
            of the US, China, Australia, and the EU combined.
            <br><br>
            <i style="padding-left: 20px;color: rgb(63, 148, 30);">
                “A vegan diet is probably the single biggest way to reduce your impact on planet Earth, not just
                greenhouse
                gases, but global acidification, eutrophication, land use and water use. It is far bigger than cutting
                down
                on your flights or buying an electric car, avoiding consumption of animal products delivers far better
                environmental benefits than trying to purchase sustainable meat and dairy.<br>
                Even the lowest impact animal products are typically creating more emissions and using more land than
                vegetable proteins, and often even the least sustainable soy milk is still better for the planet than
                most
                sustainable cows milk”</i> - Joseph Poore (Oxford Graduate, Dep. of Zoology) <sup>4</sup>
            <br><br>
            Animal agriculture produces more emissions than the whole transport sector combined <sup>5</sup>, and the UN
            (United
            Nations Environment Programme) has actually been urging us to go plant-based for a while. <sup>6 7 8</sup>
            <br><br>
            “70% of global freshwater consumption, 38% of the total land use and 19%” - Assessing the Environmental
            Impacts of Consumption and Production, UNEP Report
            <br><br>
            Plus, the Union is keen to tackle injustice issues like racism and student neglect, in terms of supporting
            these causes the Union should also fight against the injustice of factory farming too. The most oppressed
            beings in the world are farm animals, not just being ostracised but also 70 billion land animals and 1-2
            trillion marine animals slaughtered in slaughterhouses and butchered into pieces against their will.
            <sup>9</sup> No
            other sentient sensitive being on this planet goes through this trauma. If we end factory farming, we could
            also aid the fight against all other injustices, when people have respect for other sentient life and
            understand other animals suffering, they are more likely to not want to harm others in the same species.
            <br><br>
            The COVID-19 crisis that we are in currently was caused due to eating and confining animals, in these tight
            conditions it is literally a breeding ground for disease just like previous Zoonotic diseases: swine flu,
            avian flu, MERS, SARS, etc. So, by spreading awareness about a plant-based food system we could definitely
            reduce the risk of future Zoonotic diseases being spread. <sup>10</sup>
            <br><br>
            We could also feed more people if everyone were to eat plants directly instead of feeding them all to our
            livestock (since animals eat more than us and produce less in terms of calories), this would help solve
            world hunger and potentially reduce the need for food banks. <sup>11</sup>
            <br><br>
            Many other universities have also taken initiative to ban animal flesh to try combat climate change/global
            warming including University of Oxford, Cambridge, East Anglia, London, Goldsmiths, Edinburgh. <sup>12 13 14
                15</sup>
            <br><br>
            The cognitive dissonance people suffer when they are not vegan could impact mental status making them
            conflicted when talking about animal abuse in factory farms. <sup>16</sup> This can be resolved when they
            align the morals
            that they already believe (against animal cruelty) in with their actions (stop paying for animal cruelty).
            By taking part in altruistic acts (being kind to other animals, planet) this could perhaps increase mental
            health as it can make someone feel a lot better once they know they are affecting others in a positive way.
            <sup>17</sup>

        <h3>Student Parliament Believes:</h3><br>
        <p style="padding-left: 20px">
            That we should respect all life no matter what background, so harassment due to arbitrary reasons is
            unacceptable. These rights should also transfer over to all animals too: the basic rights to life and free
            from exploitation that we currently give to all people.
            <br><br>
            The Union realises the issues with not being renewable and environmentally friendly, this attitude should be
            applied to all devastating problems affecting our planet earth not just some, so encompassing the problem of
            animal agriculture into focus should be key.
            <br><br>
            The Union also promotes the betterment of mental health. Along with this the Union will also promote a Whole
            Food Plant-Based Diet(WFPBD)/vegan way of life to increase healthy wellbeing and possibly help with mental
            stress.
            <br><br>
            The Union works towards promoting peace and good for all. All these issues mentioned need to be addressed as
            well and will be brought up to light because it ties in directly what Strath Union tries to combat.
        </p>
        <br><br><br><br>
        <h3>Student Parliament Instructs:</h3><br>
        <ol style="padding-left: 40px">
            <li>The Union is keen on reducing emissions though strategic planning and modern conventions. To aid
                this, the Union will support the promotion of vegan/plant-based alternatives for the reason being ‘the
                single easiest way to reduce your emissions/impact is by going plant based’.</li>
            <li>Directly mention to people that going vegan and adopting a plant-based diet can dramatically cut
                impact on the earth by greatly reducing emissions and resource usage and provide evidence.</li>
            <li>The student Union should have a campaign section dedicated to ending the cruelty of factory farming
                of animals – not only affecting animals but slaughterhouse workers <sup>18</sup>, climate change
                affecting minorities
                <sup>19</sup>, anyone else that is being disproportionally affected.
            </li>
            <li>Veganuary should be promoted more with the whole month dedicated/focused on veganism and the
                philosophy behind it, including general tips like recipes/health/factory farming information, etc.</li>
            <li>More posts about the injustice of factory farming and information about it affecting climate change
                should be broadcasted as part of combatting global injustice so that people can learn more about what
                happens with animals. Plus, support for people that are genuinely interested to switching to a vegan
                diet (increased support can be directed towards those that are in a less fortunate situation/reliant on
                foodbanks).</li>
            <li>The Union should work stringently on a pathway to reduce the selling of animal flesh throughout
                campus, substituting in alternatives that satisfy taste, without sacrificing costs and provide foods
                that are generally healthier (keeping in mind cheap tasty and accessible options can be made vegan,
                foods like rice, beans, pasta, vegetables, fruits, etc/also keeping in mind allergic reactions to
                certain foods like nuts, soy, gluten, etc).</li>
            <li>Directly mention to people that in order to prevent or massively reduce the risk of another pandemic
                like COVID-19 we need to stop farming and confining animals.</li>
            <li>Directly mention that to feed more people than we are currently we all need to switch to a
                plant-based food system as it has been proven a plant-based diet is far less resource intensive than
                animal flesh diets.</li>
