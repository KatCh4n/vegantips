        <h1>Increasing vegan awareness policy 21/01/21</h1><br><br>
        <p style="padding-left: 20px">After noticing a lack of vegan awareness being spread by the Union, I would like
            to propose a policy that
            helps amend this: to not just help other minorities but also to help the animals suffering in horrific
            conditions for the benefit of improving human/animal wellbeing and increasing knowledge about the pollution
            of animal agriculture.</p>

        <br><br>

        <h3>Student Parliament Notes: </h3><br>
        <p style="padding-left: 20px">
            After joining the Annual General Meeting (and being impressed with the current progress of the Union) I just
            wanted to write concerning the issue of spreading more awareness about veganism. I was very pleased and
            ecstatic the union put up a Veganuary page <sup>1</sup>
            <br>
            although I believe more should be done to raise awareness to help tackle the problem.
            <br><br>
            For example, the union is keen on protecting the environment and reducing the amount of funding directed
            towards fossil fuels but why not also talk about going plant-based being one of the easiest ways to lower
            your impact and carbon footprint? Here is a 2018 Oxford study (considered the most comprehensive study
            looking at farming and the environment) proving that this is the case. <sup>2</sup>
            <br><br>
            Animal agriculture produces more emissions than the whole transport sector combined and the EU has actually
            been urging us to go plant-based for a while. <sup>3 4 5</sup>
            <br><br>
            Plus, the union is keen to tackle injustice issues like racism and student neglect, which I wholeheartedly
            support. However, why not also support the fight against the injustice of factory farming too? The most
            oppressed beings in the world are farm animals, not just being ostracised but also slaughtered against their
            will.
            <br><br>
            We all know that the COVID-19 crisis that we are in currently was caused due to eating and confining
            animals, in these tight conditions it is literally a breeding ground for disease just like previous Zoonotic
            diseases: swine flu, avian flu, MERS, SARS, etc. So by spreading awareness about a plant-based food system
            we could definitely reduce the risk of future Zoonotic diseases being spread. We could also feed more people
            if everyone was to eat plants directly instead of feeding them all to our livestock (since animals eat more
            than us and produce less in terms of calories), this would help solve world hunger and reduce the need for
            food banks. <sup>7</sup>
            <br><br>
            Many other universities have also taken initiative to ban meat to try combat climate change/global warming.
            <sup>8 9 10 11</sup>
            <br><br><br><br>
        </p>


        <h3>Student Parliament Believes:</h3><br>
        <p style="padding-left: 20px">
            That we should respect all life no matter what background, so harassment due to arbitrary reasons is
            unacceptable. I feel like this should transfer over to all animals too - the basic rights to life and free
            from exploitation that we currently give to all people.
            <br><br>
            The Union is keen on reducing emissions though strategic planning and modern conventions. To aid this, I
            believe the Union should also support the promotion of vegan/plant based alternatives since the single
            easiest way to reduce your emissions/impact is by going plant based.
            <br><br>
            The Union also promotes the betterment of mental health. Along with this I believe that the union should
            also promote a whole food plant-based diet/vegan way of life to increase wellbeing and help with mental
            stress.
            <br><br>
            I am sure the Union has its heart in the right place, however, I just feel like all these issues need to be
            addressed as well and I hope will be brought up to light, since it ties in directly what Strath Union tries
            to combat.
        </p>

        <h3>Student Parliament Instructs:</h3><br>
        <ol style="padding-left: 40px">
            <li>The student Union should have a liberation/campaign section dedicated to ending the cruelty of factory
                farming of animals (like ending the injustice against minorities).</li>
            <li>Veganuary should be promoted more with the whole month dedicated/focused on veganism and the philosophy
                behind it (like a month dedicated for African Americans), including general tips like
                recipes/health/factory farming information, etc.</li>
            <li>More posts about the injustice of factory farming should be broadcasted alongside the human injustices
                so that people can learn more about what happens with animals, plus support for people that are
                genuinely interested to switching to a vegan diet.</li>
            <li>The Union should work stringently to end the selling of animal flesh throughout campus, substituting in
                alternatives that satisfy taste, without sacrificing costs and provide foods that are generally
                healthier.</li>
            <li>Directly mention to people that going vegan and adopting a plant-based diet can dramatically cut impact
                on the earth by greatly reducing emissions and resource usage.</li>
            <li>Directly mention to people that in order to prevent or massively reduce another pandemic like COVID-19
                and to feed more people than we are currently we all need to switch to a plant-based food system.</li>
        </ol>
