            <h1>As stated by the Vegan Society and Donald Watson: "Veganism is a philosophy and way of living which seeks to 
                exclude—as far as is possible and practicable—all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, 
                animals for food, clothing or any other purpose; and by extension, promotes the development 
                and use of animal-free alternatives for the benefit of animals, humans and the environment. 
                In dietary terms it denotes the practice of dispensing with all products derived wholly or 
                partly from animals."</h1>

                The standard and “most humane” way is to put them into chambers that are lowered into CO2 
                gas while they excruciatingly thrash about in panic and agony trying to breath for air, 
                sometimes even inadvertently pulling off their own legs fighting for their lives. Burning 
                their lungs from the inside with each and every gasp of highly concentrated gas.

                Battery caged hens are given a space equal to an A4 sheet of paper. 
                Genetically breed into machines laying 300 eggs a year instead of 
                their natural 10-15 in the wild, which causes an abundance of problems. 
                free range, not that much better from the battery cages, with the slight 
                upgrade of space to move around. They suffer the same diseases and are 
                still pumped with antibiotics. Given limited access to the outside, 
                granted it might be better but it’s still not ideal for their livelihoods.
                You may think free range is the answer, but if we all ate grass fed it 
                would need an immense amount of land that we currently do not have. 
                This is why factory farming exists, it's actually more efficient, 
                sustainable and slightly better for the environment in relation to 
                less land use. Of course the cost of this is the welfare for animals, 
                but we know cutting animal products altogether actually solves most of 
                the world's problems.

        <h2>All these animals are killed very young, they are essentially baby animals in a fattened
            up adult body becuase they have been genetically bred and feed unaturally.

            "If a practice is painful and cruel for one animal, so much so that it carries
            significant criminal penalties, how can it possibly be legal for another animal
            who will also be subjected to pain and suffering.
            For example the excruciating gas chambers used in all major slaughter houses,
            'world leading','very humane','the pigs just gently fall asleep', we've been told,
            that was before extensive footage was obtained by activist, footage of pigs entering
            gas chambers thrashing around in ever increasing panic and agony as their lungs
            are seared from the inside out. Deperate to excape many of whom inadvertently pull their own
            legs off fighting for their lives." - Andy Meddock Australian MP

            So many think you have to love animals or be overly compassionate or value an animals life 
            as much as a human etc. This is not the case! :) All you have to realise is that an animals
            is more important than habit, tradition, convenience and taste. Since we can live off of a 
            well planned vegan diet (and it's been proven btw, just go to the health section. ;) ) 
            we just need to value an animals life more than the few minutes of sensory pleasure that 
            we get from eating animal flesh and secretions. Many are misconseptualised with the facts 
            of veganism, you can be a bad person or a nice person and be vegan. Ultimately it's 
            about the abuse, exploitation and cruelty that happens to animals in the industries around 
            the world. There are not nice people in the world but they still refrain from abusing 
            children of women. You don't need to nescessarily be a compassionate person to do the 
            right thing and agree with unjustified immoral acts like exploitation and abuse of the 
            innocent.
