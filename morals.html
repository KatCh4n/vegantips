            exclude—as far as is possible and practicable—all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to,
            animals for food, clothing or any other purpose; and by extension, promotes the development
            and use of animal-free alternatives for the benefit of animals, humans and the environment.
            In dietary terms it denotes the practice of dispensing with all products derived wholly or
            partly from animals."</h1>

            sometimes even inadvertently pulling off their own legs fighting for their lives. Burning

            Battery caged hens are given a space equal to an A4 sheet of paper.
            Genetically breed into machines laying 300 eggs a year instead of
            their natural 10-15 in the wild, which causes an abundance of problems.
            Free range, not that much better from the battery cages, with the slight
            upgrade of space to move around. They suffer the same diseases and are
            still pumped with antibiotics. Given limited access to the outside,
            granted it might be better but it’s still not ideal for their livelihoods.
            You may think free range is the answer, but if we all ate grass fed it
            would need an immense amount of land that we currently do not have.
            This is why factory farming exists, it's actually more efficient,
            sustainable and slightly better for the environment in relation to
            less land use. Of course the cost of this is the welfare for animals,
            but we know cutting animal products altogether actually solves most of
            the world's problems.

            "If a practice is painful and cruel for one animal, so much so that it carries
            significant criminal penalties, how can it possibly be legal for another animal
            who will also be subjected to pain and suffering.
            For example the excruciating gas chambers used in all major slaughter houses,
            'world leading','very humane','the pigs just gently fall asleep', we've been told,
            that was before extensive footage was obtained by activist, footage of pigs entering
            gas chambers thrashing around in ever increasing panic and agony as their lungs
            are seared from the inside out. Deperate to excape many of whom inadvertently pull their own
            legs off fighting for their lives." - Andy Meddock Australian MP

            So many think you have to love animals or be overly compassionate or value an animals life
            as much as a human etc. This is not the case! :) All you have to realise is that an animals
            is more important than habit, tradition, convenience and taste. Since we can live off of a
            well planned vegan diet (and it's been proven btw, just go to the health section. ;) )
            we just need to value an animals life more than the few minutes of sensory pleasure that
            we get from eating animal flesh and secretions. Many are misconseptualised with the facts
            of veganism, you can be a bad person or a nice person and be vegan. Ultimately it's
            about the abuse, exploitation and cruelty that happens to animals in the industries around
            the world. There are not nice people in the world but they still refrain from abusing
            children of women. You don't need to nescessarily be a compassionate person to do the
            right thing and agree with unjustified immoral acts like exploitation and abuse of the
            innocent. Say, you don't need to be a lover of all black people to be anti-racist, you
            just need to respect them for who they are and not subjugate them to any oppression.
            Also you don't need know every human to wish for them to have a good life, just like
            you don't need to know every farm animals and wish for them to have a good life,
            free from exploitation, some may only know our pets but that love can be extended to
            other animals they don't know.
            <br>
            So what if I was a alien species but I was human-like, I could talk to you guys,
            understand human stuff but my skin was another colour or smth. Would it be ok to kill me?
            <br>
            Imagine you were vulnerable and someone took care of you, have you a nice life,
            then one day said they were going to kill you with no pain. Would you be happy with that?

            "Trikkeeroy ah yes the appeal to tradition fallacy. Why are you basing our morality on the actions of our
            ancestors, primitive beings that had no perception of modern day morality and did entirely unethical things
            such murder and rape without consequence? Surely if eating is animals is acceptable because cavemen did it,
            then raping and murdering one another today must also be morally justifiable?
            <br><br>
            Do you think it is wise to base our morality on the actions of our primitive ancestors?
            <br><br>
            If it’s morally justifiable to eat animals because our ancestors used to do it, does that not mean that it
            must also be morally justifiable to murder each other, as our ancestors use to do that as well?
            <br><br>
            If non-vegans really want to live like their ancestors then you would eat a predominantly vegan diet with
            the exception of some occasional insects. You would also sleep outside, not use technology, speak in
            primitive and underdeveloped languages, get overly excited by the creation of fire and have incestuous
            experiences. Another thing people will say similar to the ancestors argument is that “we’ve always eaten
            meat”. It is such a regressive idea to look into the past for how we should live and basing our actions
            purely on whether or not we’ve done something for a long period of time is certainly not a good idea, if we
            did that we would still have slavery and apartheid.
            <br><br>
            There was a time when treating a woman as less than a man was all we’d ever done, would that make treating a
            woman as less than a man morally acceptable today? Tied in closely with the ancestors argument is the idea
            that eating meat helped us evolve into the beings that we are today and because of that it is morally
            justifiable to continue eating animals. It is common knowledge and widely accepted that we evolved from
            primates who survived on a diet comprised predominantly of fruits, nuts, leaves and the occasional insects,
            but our diets have changed and evolved as the environments we’ve lived in have changed and evolved. It is
            often cited that the reason we are so intelligent now is because we ate meat and many non-vegans claim that
            it helped us develop and evolve. Even if this is true, it has no relevance to our society today as our
            brains are not developing every time we eat a big mac, nor are we evolving as a species every time we enter
            Nando’s. Quite the opposite in fact.
            <br><br>
            Eating animal products is a hinderance to our health, as opposed to being beneficial. Consuming foods that
            have a negative impact on our health can therefore not be considered helpful to the evolution of our
            species. Because of eating animal products, we are dying younger than we would be without them. Couple that
            with the fact that animal agriculture is responsible for more greenhouse gas emissions than the entire
            transportation system combined and is the leading cause of rainforest destruction, oceanic dead zones,
            species extinction, top soil erosion, land desertification and a whole host of other environmental concerns,
            it quickly becomes apparent that the future of our evolution depends on us not eating animals. The United
            Nations has in fact stated that the world needs to shift to a plantbased diet in order to avoid the worst
            effects of climate change.
            <br><br>
            Furthermore, there are also other theories as to why our brains developed. The first is that we began to eat
            cooked starchy foods and more carbohydrate dense foods. These starches would have been readily available and
            with the brain using 60% of the human body’s blood glucose, such high glucose demands would not have been
            met on a low carbohydrate diet. Another idea is that we expanded our consciousness by consuming
            hallucinogenic mushrooms which allowed us to access parts of our brain previously unexplored, which
            therefore ultimately made us more self-aware and intelligent. Now undoubtedly eating animals helped us
            survive through times of food scarcity but just as the very foundations of much our society was built upon
            slavery doesn’t justify slavery in today’s world, the fact that eating animals helped us get to this point
            or helped us survive in the past, doesn’t justify eating animals in today’s world. In contemporary society
            we don’t need to eat animals or their secretions and in doing so we are shortening our lifespan, destroying
            our planet and causing an unimaginable amount of unnecessary harm to innocent, living beings.
            <br><br>
            As for your “it’s only been around for less than a century fallacy,” let’s take a look at the facts shall
            we?
            <br><br>
            Just looking and studying human anatomy, again, it seems we are built to eat plants, and “substantial
            evidence shows that the ancestral lineage that led to humans had a plant-based diet.” The bottom line is
            that most ancient humans, and human-like creatures, were predominately vegan. Some ate meat, but many
            didn’t. For example, Neanderthals in Spain ate no meat at all, according to a study published by Nature.

            Rob Dunn goes into greater detail about this issue, from an evolutionary perspective, bringing up multiple
            points about how our guts evolved to stick to a vegetarian (vegan) diet. Human Ancestors Were Nearly All
            Vegetarians: <a

            <br><br>
            A great article I like to point people towards comes from University of Utah geochemist Thure Cerling, who
            spearheaded a set of fairly recent new studies that show how early humans and their ancestors and relatives
            made a surprising dietary switch some 3.5 million years ago, changing from an ape-like diet of mostly leaves
            and fruits and shrubs to a grass-based diet of grasses and sedges. I’m just trying to hammer home the fact
            that it’s been strongly established in scientific literature that ancient human-like ‘ancestors’
            predominately ate plant-based diets.
            <br><br>
            A Grassy Trend in Human Ancestors’ Diets: <a

            <br><br>
            By your own admission stating that humans are omnivores, is stating that we can survive and thrive without
            consuming any animal products. Are you making the absurd and nonsensical assertion that since humans are
            “behavioural omnivores” so therefore I have no control over my actions and it’s a necessity to eat animals,
            means our actions are predetermined for us by biological determinism. This would then mean that humans do
            not have reason. Do humans have reason?"
